# Session Based Login
Simple session based login POC for Reddit and reference material
This was used to demonstrate OOP practices, static classes vs non-static classes, proper authentication procedures, proper password storage procedures, proper DB querying procedures, etc.
This has NOT been tested, or even ran. It was thrown together to demonstrate the principle behind using session tokens instead of a user id session.
